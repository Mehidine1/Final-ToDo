```

## Description
This app offers its users the ability to add tasks, delete them, edit them, along with priorities and deadlines. Due to technical issues (my laptop's hard disk and SSD being corrupted, i lost the previous implemented features such as exporting the list as pdf, or sending it as an email ***Code of previous work can be provided and may be updated later***.)

## Firebase
****Google Firebase**** is a Google-backed application development software that enables developers to develop iOS, Android and Web apps. Firebase provides tools for tracking analytics, reporting and fixing app crashes, creating marketing and product experiment.
Firebase was used instead of php/mysql, android room and MongoDB due to its simplicity and various benefits:
* Create Application without backend server

* Sync real time data in the application
* Quick display data in the application
* Faster then any backend web services
* No SQL database so it is more faster
* You can provide any social networking login with very few lines code 
* Push notification
* Analytics
* Crash reports
* Cloud storage
